The Derive tool is used to generate formulaic instances for data types. For example given
a data type, the Derive tool can generate 34 instances, including the standard ones
(Eq, Ord, Enum etc.) and others such as Binary and Functor. Derive can be used with SYB,
Template Haskell or as a standalone preprocessor. This tool serves a similar role to DrIFT,
but with additional features.

Recently Derive has had many derivations added, including new Uniplate~\cref{uniplate} instances. The
mechanism to derive instances by example has been rewritten, and the revised mechanism is
described in the associated  Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming 2009 paper.
