CmdArgs is a library for defining and parsing command lines. The focus of CmdArgs is allowing
the concise definition of fully-featured command line argument processors, in a mainly
declarative manner (i.e., little coding needed). Compared to the standard GetOpt library, CmdArgs
is often about three times shorter. CmdArgs also supports multiple mode programs,
for example as used in git/darcs/Cabal.
