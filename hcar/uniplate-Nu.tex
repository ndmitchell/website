Uniplate is a library for writing simple and concise generic operations.
Uniplate has similar goals to the original Scrap Your Boilerplate work,
but is substantially simpler and faster. If you are writing any sort of compiler,
you should be using a generics library. If you do not know any generics libraries,
Uniplate is a good place to start.

Uniplate has recently undergone major revisions. The new version drops Haskell 98
compatibility, in favor of Haskell 2010 compatibility --- simplifying the module layout.
All the instances have been revised with a focus on performance. Some of the instances
can now be generated by the Derive tool~\cref{Derive}. The instances based on the Data
class have been optimized and extended --- they now work on more types, and run faster.
