HLint is a tool that reads Haskell code and suggests changes to make it simpler.
For example, if you call \texttt{maybe foo id} it will suggest using \texttt{fromMaybe foo} instead.
HLint is compatible with almost all Haskell extensions, and can be easily extended with additional hints.

There have been numerous feature improvements since the last HCAR, including an API, and better support
for qualified module names. HLint is now used within hpaste.org%~\cref{hpaste}
.
