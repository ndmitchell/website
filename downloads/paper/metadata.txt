    Given an appropriate domain specific language (DSL), it is possible
    to describe the relationship between Haskell data types and many
    generic functions, typically type-class instances. While describing
    the relationship is possible, it is not always an easy task. There is an
    alternative - simply give one example output for a carefully chosen
    input, and have the relationship derived.

    When deriving a relationship from only one example, it is important
    that the derived relationship is the intended one.We identify
    general restrictions on the DSL, and on the provided example, to
    ensure a level of predictability. We then apply these restrictions in
    practice, to derive the relationship between Haskell data types and
    generic functions. We have used our scheme in the Derive tool,
    where over 60% of type classes are derived from a single example.

    We describe a transformation which takes a higher-order program,
    and produces an equivalent first-order program. Unlike Reynolds-style
    defunctionalisation, it does not introduce any new data types,
    and the results are more amenable to subsequent analysis operations.
    We can use our method to improve the results of existing
    analysis operations, including strictness analysis, pattern-match
    safety and termination checking. Our transformation is implemented,
    and works on a Core language to which Haskell programs
    can be reduced. Our method cannot always succeed in removing
    all functional values, but in practice is remarkably successful.

        This thesis describes techniques for transforming and analysing functional programs. We operate on a core language, to which Haskell programs can be reduced. We present a range of techniques, all of which have been implemented and evaluated.

        We make programs shorter by defining a library which abstracts over common data traversal patterns, removing boilerplate code. This library only supports traversals having value-specific behaviour for one type, allowing a simpler programming model. Our library allows concise expression of traversals with competitive performance.

        We make programs faster by applying a variant of supercompilation. As a result of practical experiments, we have identified modifications to the standard supercompilation techniques -- particularly with respect to let bindings and the generalisation technique.
        
        We make programs safer by automatically checking for potential pattern-match errors. We define a transformation that takes a higher-order program and produces an equivalent program with fewer functional values, typically a first-order program. We then define an analysis on a first-order language which checks statically that, despite the possible use of partial (or non-exhaustive) pattern matching, no pattern-match failure can occur.

    We describe an automated analysis of Haskell 98 programs to
    check statically that, despite the possible use of partial (or nonexhaustive)
    pattern matching, no pattern-match failure can occur.
    Our method is an iterative backward analysis using a novel form
    of pattern-constraint to represent sets of data values. The analysis
    is defined for a core first-order language to which Haskell 98
    programs are reduced. Our analysis tool has been successfully
    applied to a range of programs, and our techniques seem to scale
    well. Throughout the paper, methods are represented much as we
    have implemented them in practice, again in Haskell.

    This article gives an overview of the Hoogle tool. We describe the history of Hoogle,
    the improvements that have been made this summer, and plans for future features.
    Finally, we discuss the design guidelines of Hoogle 4 - which may be of interest
    both to budding Hoogle developers and other Haskell projects. This article does not
    cover the theoretical background of Hoogle.

    Haskell is a functional language, with features such as higher
    order functions and lazy evaluation, which allow succinct programs. These
    high-level features present many challenges for optimising compilers. We
    report practical experiments using novel variants of supercompilation,
    with special attention to let bindings and the generalisation technique.

    A function is said to be generic if it operates over values of
    any data type. For example, a generic equality function can test pairs of
    booleans, integers, lists, trees etc. In most languages programmers must
    define generic functions multiple times, specialised for each data type.
    Alternatively, a tool could be used to specify the relationship between the
    data type and the implementation, but this relationship may be complex.
    This paper describes a solution: given a single example of the generic
    function on one data type, we can infer the relationship between a data
    type and the implementation. We have used our method in the Derive
    tool, allowing the implementation of 60% of the generic functions to be
    inferred.

    Generic traversals over recursive data structures are often referred
    to as boilerplate code. The definitions of functions involving such
    traversals may repeat very similar patterns, but with variations for
    different data types and different functionality. Libraries of operations
    abstracting away boilerplate code typically rely on elaborate
    types to make operations generic. The motivating observation for
    this paper is that most traversals have value-specific behaviour for
    just one type. We present the design of a new library exploiting
    this assumption. Our library allows concise expression of traversals
    with competitive performance.

    Haskell is a functional language, with features such as higher
    order functions and lazy evaluation, which allow succinct programs. These
    high-level features are difficult for fast execution, but GHC is a mature
    and widely used optimising compiler. This paper presents a whole-program
    approach to optimisation, which produces speed improvements
    of between 10% and 60% when used with GHC, on eight benchmarks.

    Programs written in Haskell may fail at runtime with either a
    pattern match error, or with non-termination. Both of these can be
    thought of as giving the value $\bot$ as a result. Other forms of
    failure, for example heap exhaustion, are not considered.

    The first section of this document reviews previous work, including
    total functional programming and sized types. Attention is paid to
    termination checkers for both Prolog and various functional
    languages.

    The main result from work so far is a static checker for pattern
    match errors that allows non-exhaustive patterns to exist, yet
    ensures that a pattern match error does not occur. It includes a
    constraint language that can be used to reason about pattern
    matches, along with mechanisms to propagate these constraints
    between program components.

    The proposal deals with future work to be done. It gives an
    approximate timetable for the design and implementation of a static
    checker for termination and pattern match errors.
