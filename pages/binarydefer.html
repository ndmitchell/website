title=Deferred Binary
tags=library haskell

<p>
    This library provides a framework for doing binary serialisation, with support for deferred loading.
    Deferred loading is for when a large data structure exists, but typically only a small fraction of this data structure will be required. By using deferred loading, some of the data structure can be read quickly, and the rest can be read on demand.
