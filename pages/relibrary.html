	This library will be coming soon, and is for working with the theory of regular expressions and state machines. A <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a> library for manipulating regular expressions. It is very different from <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Text.Regex.html">Text.Regex</a>. It is intended to release this library as open source.
</p>

<p>
	You can view early and incomplete <a href="http://haskell.org/haddock/">Haddock</a> documentation for the library <a href="projects/relibrary/index.html">here</a>. If you are interested in this library then please <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/">contact me</a>, particularly if you have any feedback or would like to use the library.
</p>

<h2>External Tools</h2>

<p>
	In order to generate cool graphs you will need <tt>dot</tt> installed on your system. It's available from <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">http://www.graphviz.org/</a>. Everything else requires any Haskell compiler/interpreter.
