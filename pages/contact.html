    I welcome enquiries about any of my projects. If the email is of general interest, it may be useful to CC <:email "haskell-cafe@haskell.org">. I can also be reached at my University address (<:email "ndm@cs.york.ac.uk">), but this is forwarded to my Gmail address.
</p>

<p>
    Alternatively, I am often on the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel">Haskell IRC channel</a> as <tt>ndm</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Other contact addresses</h2>

<p>
	For some of the stuff on my website, there are mailing lists which will reach more people than just me, so are usually a better idea if your question relates to that particular topic. I read all of these lists.
