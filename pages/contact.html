    Alternatively, I am often on the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel">Haskell IRC channel</a> as <tt>ndm</tt>.

<h2>Other contact addresses</h2>

<p>
	For some of the stuff on my website, there are mailing lists which will reach more people than just me, so are usually a better idea if your question relates to that particular topic. I read all of these lists.
