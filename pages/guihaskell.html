<p>
	<b>Warning:</b> This project is fragile, unfinished, and I do not recommend that anyone tries using it. Give me a few months at least. Some functionality which has still not been finished includes loading files and executing commands :)
</p>
<p>
	I am writing a GUI to vaious Haskell implementations (Hugs, GHCi, <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/yhc/">Yhc</a>) for all platforms, called GuiHaskell. It is written in Haskell, using <a href="http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/">Gtk2Hs</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Note that GuiHaskell requires [[proplang]], an as yet entirely undocumented side project of mine.
