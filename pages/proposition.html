<p>
    This library handles propositions, logical formulae consisting of literals without quantification. It automatically simplifies a proposition as it is constructed using simple rules provided by the programmer. Implementations of propositions in terms of an abstract syntax tree and as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram">Binary Decision Diagram</a> (BDD) are provided. A standard interface is provided for all propositions.

<p>
    This implementation comes originally from [[catch]]. For a simple example of this libraries use, see the Haddock documentation.
