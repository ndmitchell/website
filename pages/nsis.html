<p>
    NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System,
    <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">http://nsis.sourceforge.net/</a>) is
    a tool that allows programmers to create installers for Windows. This
    library provides an alternative syntax for NSIS scripts, as an embedded
    Haskell language, removing much of the hard work in developing an install
    script. Simple NSIS installers should look mostly the same, complex ones
    should be significantly more maintainable.
