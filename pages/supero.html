	<b>Latest Version:</b> The latest current version of my supercompiler is available <a href="http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/temp/supercompiler.zip">here</a>. It follows the design of a draft paper I am working on.
</p><p>
    This is my effort to optimise Haskell. This project is also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven">-O11</a>, after the compiler flag in Yhc which will implement these features.

	The IFL 2007 paper was awarded the <a href="http://www.ifl-workshops.org/">Peter Landin</a> prize for the best paper presented at the symposium that year, as selected by the programme committee.
