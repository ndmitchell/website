<p>
    This tool takes a Latex document, usually intended for consumption with <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~loeh/lhs2tex/">lhs2tex</a>, and attempts to type check it. While <a href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/literate.html">literate Haskell</a> is great for writing a document which is a complete piece of code, when writing fragments of code interspersed with alternative definitions it can be tricky. Tex2hs takes a .tex file, and automatically tries to splice the fragments together in a way that type checks.
