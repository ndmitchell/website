    I'm a Haskell programmer who lives in Cambridge with my wife <a href="https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/people/research-students/emily-mitchell">Emily</a> and son Henry (who has grown up a little since the photo on the right was taken). I have a PhD in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/">York University</a>, working on making functional programs shorter, faster and safer. Since then I've worked with F# at <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/">Credit Suisse</a> and Haskell/C++ at <a href="http://www.standardchartered.com/">Standard Chartered</a>, taking the lessons of functional programming and applying them in finance. I'm a strong believer in the functional approach, finding the combination of conciseness, static-typing and testability to offer significant advantages - see <a href="http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/">my blog</a> for more.

<h2>Open Source Projects</h2>

<p>
    I develop a number of open source Haskell projects, all of which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell">my Github page</a>. Some of my more popular projects include:
</p>
<ul class="space">
    <li><b><!shake></b> - a library for writing build systems, an alternative to <tt>make</tt>.</li>
    <li><b><!hoogle></b> - a Haskell API search engine, searching the standard Haskell libraries by function name and type signature.</li>
    <li><b><!hlint></b> - an automatic analysis tool to suggest improvements to Haskell code.</li>
    <li><b><!uniplate></b> - a library for writing concise traversals over data types.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>
    My research interests cover functional programming and the theoretical side of computer science, a complete list of my papers can be found under <!downloads>. My current research topics include:
</p>
<ul class="space">
    <li><b>Supercompilation</b> - a technique for optimising programs in a general yet powerful way. Advanced optimising compilers are complex, my hope is that supercompilation can simplify them and improve the performance <!supero more>.</li>
    <li><b>Generic programming</b> - functional programs tend to be more concise than alternatives, but often they still contain repitition of redundancies. This repitition is both time consuming to write and a common source of bugs. There are many approaches to generic programming, but I focus on approaches that are both simple and low-overhead, sacrificing flexibility and power <!uniplate more>.</li>
    <li><b>Build systems</b> - while <tt>make</tt> is unbiquitous, it is not without its flaws. I have worked on build systems that let people express dependencies more precisely, resulting in faster and more accurate rebuilds <!shake more>.</li>
</ul>
