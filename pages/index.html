	I was previously an <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">EPSRC funded</a> PhD student in the <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/">Computer Science Department</a> at the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/">University of York</a>, England, in the <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/plasma/">Programming Languages and Systems Research Group</a> (PLASMA), supervised by <a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~colin/">Colin Runciman</a>. I have now finished my PhD, and am working for <a href="http://www.standardchartered.com/">Standard Chartered</a>.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>
    My main research interest is functional programming, typically using the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> programming language.
</p>
<ul class="space">
    <li><b>Program Transformation</b> - I have a strong interest in program transformation and analysis <!thesis more>. In particular I am intersested in making certain types of static analysis more applicable <!firstify more>, and developing new techniques to eliminate program crashes <!catch more>. I am also interested in improving the performance of programs <!supero more>.</li>

    <li><b>Programmer Support</b> - I have a particular desire to see Windows supported as standard by all the Haskell tools and libraries. I have rewritten <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hugs/">WinHugs</a> <!winhugs more>, am the main Windows developer on the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Yhc">Yhc</a> team <!yhc more>, and would like to see a Windows GUI for Yhc/GHC <!guihaskell more>. I am also interested in creating tools to make functional programming easier, such as API search tools <!hoogle more>, programmer support tools <!drhaskell more> and general libraries <!:library more>.</li>

    <li><b>Parsing</b> - I think parsing as it stands could be far better. I have many ideas of improvements to parsing technology, including faster and more easily specified parser generators in a language independant way <!parsing more>. I also have time complexity improvements to existing phases of existing parser systems <!helix more>. Much of this work revolves around regular expressions, and their simplification <!resimplify more>.</li>
