	I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/">Computer Science Department</a> at the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/">University of York</a>, England, in the <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/plasma/">Programming Languages and Systems Research Group</a> (PLASMA), and am supervised by <a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~colin/">Colin Runciman</a>. I have an MEng in Computer Systems and Software Engineering from York. This website relates only to my academic work, for personal information on me see <a href="http://www.nmitchell.co.uk/">www.nmitchell.co.uk</a>. I have a few [[notes|notes]] on the department, and how to do things.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<ul class="space">
    <li><b>Functional Programming</b> - Most things I do involve <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> in some way. I have a particular desire to see Windows supported as standard by all the Haskell tools and libraries. I have rewritten <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hugs/">WinHugs</a> <!winhugs more>, am the main Windows developer on the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Yhc">Yhc</a> team <!yhc more>, and would like to see a Windows GUI for Yhc/GHC <!guihaskell more>. I am also interested in creating tools to make functional programming easier, such as API search tools <!hoogle more>, programmer support tools <!drhaskell more> and general libraries <!:library more>.</li>

	<li><b>Static Analysis</b> - It's annoying and unhelpful when a program crashes. What if all crashes could be eliminated? What if the number of crashes could be reduced. How much work would a programmer be prepared to do in order to get greater safety guarantees about their code? <!catch more></li>

	<li><b>Regular Expressions</b> - Everything I do seems to come back to regular expressions. They are simple but have a deep inner beauty. I am interested in simplifying them <!resimplify more>, evaluating them and using them in larger projects.</li>

	<li><b>Parsing</b> - I think parsing as it stands could be far better. I have many ideas of improvements to parsing technology, including faster and more easily specified parser generators in a language independant way <!parsing more>. I also have time complexity improvements to existing phases of existing parser systems <!helix more>.</li>
</ul>
