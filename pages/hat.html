<p>
	I have done a very small amount of work on <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hat/">Hat</a>.
	I have compiled Hat for Windows, and am writing a GUI for Hat.

<h2>Hat on Windows</h2>

<p>
	Download from <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/fp/temp/hat-win32-05_jul_2006.zip">here</a>.
</p><p>
	All hat utilities are available and seem to work apart from:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>hat-explore - advanced escape codes, looks pretty hard to get round</li>
	<li>hat-anim - escape codes, might be able to work round</li>
	<li>hat-detect - tries to spawn an xterm</li>
</ul>
<p>
	In addition, there is also hat-make, which is windows only hmake -hat
	alternative.
</p>

<h2>Instructions for installing</h2>

<p>
	Extract the contents of the .zip file into a folder preserving
	directory structure.
</p><p>
	Add the folder containing hat-make to your %PATH% variable, this is
	100% required, even if you give the explicit path to hat-make when you
	use it.
</p><p>
	Make sure <a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/">ghc</a> is available on your system and has been added to the %PATH%.
</p>

<h2>Instructions for use</h2>

<p>
	cd to the directory containing your Haskell source
</p>
<pre>
hat-make Main.hs
main <i>arguments</i>
hat-stack Main.hat
hat-observe Main.hat
etc.
</pre>
<p>
	I have tested the programs, and they all work quite well - I have not
	run into any limitations beyond those which happen on Hat on Linux as
	well.
