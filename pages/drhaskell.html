	Dr Haskell is a tool to detect common mistakes in Haskell programs.

<p>
	Dr Haskell can only be compiled by GHC 6.10.1 or above (it makes use of view patterns), but does not require any copy of GHC to run. Dr Haskell should be able to give hints for any Haskell code, including most GHC extensions. As with any good tool, Dr Haskell has been used in the development of itself, and all suggestions have been fixed.
