<p>
	FilePath is a Haskell library for manipulating <tt>FilePath</tt> values in a cross-platform way on both Windows and Unix/Linux. This library is now part of the core Haskell libraries, and since GHC 6.6.1 has been shipped with all major compilers. While I am the original author, changes are now made through the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Library_submissions">library submissions</a> process.
