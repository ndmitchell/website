<p>
    The FilePath library is a library for manipulating FilePaths in a cross platform way on both Windows and Unix.
</p>
<p>
    This FilePath library was originally from <!yhc>, and was tweaked in a long process on the Haskell mailing lists, until an acceptable interface was found for everyone. The library is now part of the core Haskell libraries, and as of GHC 6.6.1 is shipped with all major compilers.
