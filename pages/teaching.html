<h2>Lectures</h2>

<p>
    I gave three lectures for the 2007/8 Algorithms and Data Structures course, on the topics of "Types in Ada", "Generics in Ada" and "Software Testing".
</p>
<p>
    I prepared and delivered one lecture for the 2006/7 Algorithms and Data Structures course, focusing on Ada and the use of generics. The slides are available at the bottom of this page.

<h2>Marking</h2>

<p>
    I was responsible for marking half the reports from the open assessment for the 2006/7 Algorithms and Data Structures course. I also contributed to the setting of the exam, and the organisation of the other necessary marking.
