<h2>Lectures</h2>

<p>
    I have prepared and given one lecture so far, for the Algorithms and Data Structures course, focusing on Ada and the use of generics. The slides are available at the bottom of this page.

<h2>Marking</h2>

<p>
    I was responsible for marking half the reports from the open assessment for the Algorithms and Data Structures course. I also contributed to the setting of the exam, and the organisation of the other necessary marking.
