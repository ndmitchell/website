title=Catch: Case Totality Checker for Haskell
shortname=Catch
tags=haskell phd yhc program

<p>
	A Haskell program may fail at runtime with a pattern-match error if the program has any incomplete (non-exhaustive) patterns in definitions or case alternatives. The Catch tool is a static checker that allows non-exhaustive patterns to exist, yet ensures that a pattern-match error does not occur. This work was part of my PhD and is now unmaintained and unlikely to work.
