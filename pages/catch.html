<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
	A Haskell program may fail at runtime with a pattern-match error if the program has any incomplete (non-exhaustive) patterns in definitions or case alternatives. This paper describes a static checker that allows non-exhaustive patterns to exist, yet ensures that a pattern-match error does not occur. It describes a constraint language that can be used to reason about pattern matches, along with mechanisms to propagate these constraints between program components. The checker can handle some higher-order functions.

    The following programs and libraries have all had some of their source code verified by Catch. If you verify a released Haskell project with Catch, please let me know your experiences. To indicate that you have taken the time to ensure pattern match safety, you may use the following "Checked with Catch" logo.
